CAR PRICE PREDICTION - KAGGLE DATASET

Dataset Description
The car price prediction dataset available on Kaggle is all about the technical details of various car models. The dataset includes both technical and price details of the cars. The main aim of the dataset is to predict car prices based on given features such as engine power, mileage, manufacturing year, etc.

Problem Addressed
The main problem that this dataset addresses is car price prediction. Given a set of car features like engine power, mileage, manufacturing year, etc., the goal is to predict the car's price. This is a regression task since the car price is a continuous quantity.

Existing Solutions
There are several solutions (notebooks) already developed on Kaggle for this dataset. These solutions include different modeling approaches and techniques like linear regression, random forest regression, support vector regression, etc.

The minimum necessary solution to be able to train and save a model would include:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing
- Training a regression model
- Model evaluation
- Saving the trained model

Model Scope
The scope of this project is to serve as a proof of concept for car price prediction. While the model will be trained and tested on the Kaggle dataset, the ultimate goal is to demonstrate how data science and machine learning can be applied to real-world problems.

Beyond the solutions already created on Kaggle, several other models can be trained on this dataset. Some of these could include deep learning models like neural networks, or ensemble techniques like boosting.

The final output of this project would be a trained model that can predict a car's price given certain features. This model could be used in an application or a website to predict a car's price in real time.
